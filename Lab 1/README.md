AI Number Guessing Game

Overview

This project implements three AI number guessing games using Random Walk, DFS (Depth-First Search), and BFS (Breadth-First Search) approaches. The AI attempts to guess a number between 1 and 100 based on user feedback.

Game Modes:

	1.	Random Walk: AI guesses randomly, narrowing the range based on feedback.
	2.	DFS: AI uses a stack and random guesses to simulate a depth-first search.
	3.	BFS: AI uses a queue and random guesses to simulate a breadth-first search.
