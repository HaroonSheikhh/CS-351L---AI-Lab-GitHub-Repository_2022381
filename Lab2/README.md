Pac-Man A* Pathfinding Game

Overview

This project simulates a simple Pac-Man game where Pac-Man navigates a grid to reach the finish point using A pathfinding*. Ghosts chase Pac-Man, and obstacles are randomly placed on the grid. The game visualizes both Pac-Man’s and ghosts’ paths.

Features

•Grid Generation: User-defined grid size with random placement of Pac-Man, ghosts, and obstacles.

•A Pathfinding*: Pac-Man and ghosts use the A* algorithm to find the shortest path.

•Obstacle Avoidance: Random obstacles are added to the grid, and the paths are calculated accordingly.

•Ghost Chase: Ghosts attempt to chase Pac-Man from their random positions using A*.
