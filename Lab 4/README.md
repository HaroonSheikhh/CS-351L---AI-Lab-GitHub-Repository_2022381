Titanic Survival Prediction

Overview

This project predicts Titanic passenger survival using two classifiers:

•k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors)
•Decision Tree

The dataset is preprocessed, models are trained, and performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Decision boundaries are also visualized.

Steps:

1.Preprocessing: Handles missing data, encodes categorical features, and scales numeric ones.
2.Model Training: Trains k-NN and Decision Tree classifiers.
3.Evaluation: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4.Visualization: Plots decision boundaries for Pclass and Age.
